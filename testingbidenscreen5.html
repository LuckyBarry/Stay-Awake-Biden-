                    "anti-sleepy-gas" of some sort!
                    Unfortunately, it can only be deployed by the person with the highest security ranking.
                    This means you sir, Mister President, must make a 3 mile hike through a secret tunnel, from here to
                    the Pentagon, in order to save the world! I say let's waste no more time, and get this show on the
                    road! Mind you, during the trip, you will be asked several questions by a computersystem, for
                    security purposes only. And whatever happens: <br>DO NOT FALL ASLEEP! Good Luck!
